## About The Project

This library is a Python binding to the [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust) library that was written by Brave's browser team. The binding uses [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) to interact with the rust package.


### Built With

* [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
* [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust)


### Installation

```sh
pip3 install braveblock
```


## Usage

```python
import braveblock


# Initialize the engine loaded with a rules list
# One can download easylist and load its lines into the engine
adblocker = braveblock.Adblocker(
    include_easylist=False,             # Whether to include easylist rules. True by default
    include_easyprivacy=False,          # Whether to include easyprivacy rules. True by default
    rules=[                             # A list of custom rules to load into the engine
        "-advertisement-icon.",
        "-advertisement/script.",
    ]
)

# This function checks whether the specified url should be blocked
adblocker.check_network_urls(
    url="http://example.com/-advertisement-icon.",
    source_url="http://example.com/helloworld",
    request_type="image",
)
```
